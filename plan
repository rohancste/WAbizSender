**CRM WhatsApp Notification Bot (WAHA) - Overview & Instructions**

---

### 🌟 Objective:
Create a bot that automatically sends **CRM caller assignment summaries** and eventually **daily call analytics** to internal WhatsApp groups using the **WAHA API**.

---
### 👨‍📋 Use Case:
- Used internally by CSTE International.
- Sends assignment summaries to the group: `120363418230720597@g.us` (Giant Leap group).
- Used during Hiring, CRM, and other workflows.

---

### 🔄 Project Relationship:
- **NOT** part of the IndiaMART bot.
- **YES**, it belongs to the **WABizSender** project.
- WAHA API will be used for internal notifications.

---

### ✅ Phase 1: Caller Assignment Notifications
Each day, send a message like the following to the WhatsApp group:

```
Calls assigned Komal
- Total Calls - 157
- Fresh - 52
- Abandoned - 50
- CNP - 54
- Follow up - 01
- NDR - 0

Calls assigned Deepasha
- Total Calls - 164
- Fresh - 51
- Abandoned - 50
- CNP - 41
- Follow up - 10
- NDR - 2
```

---

### 🔧 What the Bot Needs to Do:

1. **Input CRM data** (from Google Sheet, Baserow, etc.):
```json
[
  {
    "name": "Komal",
    "total": 157,
    "fresh": 52,
    "abandoned": 50,
    "cnp": 54,
    "follow_up": 1,
    "ndr": 0
  },
  {
    "name": "Deepasha",
    "total": 164,
    "fresh": 51,
    "abandoned": 50,
    "cnp": 41,
    "follow_up": 10,
    "ndr": 2
  }
]
```

2. **Format a readable WhatsApp message** as shown above.
3. **Send it using WAHA** to the specified group.

---

### 🔢 Tech Notes:
- WAHA session must be active and part of the WhatsApp group.
- `enhanced_sender.py` is the script used to send messages.
- This message should be sent once per day — ideally after call assignment.

---

### 🔄 Future Phase: Analytics (Daily Summary)
Later, you will extend the bot to send:
- Total calls made
- Confirmed COD
- Cancelled
- Not Reachable, etc.

Format Example:
```
📊 Daily Call Summary - 1st May
- Total Calls Made: 105
- Confirmed COD: 72
- Cancelled: 13
- Not Reachable: 20
➡️ Good job team! ✅
```
